                <p>Every student has a journey - some start close to home, others come from far away. This platform 
                    is made for international students at CMD who took the brave step to move to a new country to study.</p>
                
                <p>Here, you can read personal stories from students like you. Stories about starting over, learning a new 
                    language, missing home, making friends, and finding your place at CMD.</p>    
                <p>Whether youâ€™re looking for comfort, recognition, or just curiosity - you are not alone.</p>

                <p>Feel free to explore the stories or share your own.</p>
