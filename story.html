                <p>I love design, but group projects were hard at first. Everyone had opinions, everyone talked over each other - I didn’t grow up with that.
At home, we wait. We listen. Here, silence is awkward. It took me a while to adjust. But now, I actually like that people say what they think. It makes things faster, clearer.
What helped me most was meeting students outside of class - going to CMD events, game nights, even karaoke once. That’s where I really started feeling part of something.
I still miss Korean food, and sometimes I just need to call my mom. But CMD feels like a second home now.
